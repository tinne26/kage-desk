# Configure your editor for `.kage` files

There are two ways:
- Set your `.kage` files to be highlighted like `.go` files.
- Use [sedyh/ebitengine-kage](https://github.com/sedyh/ebitengine-kage-vscode) plugins for VSCode, Sublime or Vim.

If you decide to go with the first option:
- **VSCode**: open a `.kage` file, press F1 to open the search, type "language", select `Change Language Mode`, then `Configure File Association for '.kage'`, and select `Go` from the list of options.
- **Sublime**: open a `.kage` file and go to `View`, then `Syntax`, then `Open all with current extension as...` and choose `Go`.
- **Vim**: open a `.kage` file and use `:set syntax=go`.
- ...
