- [Ebitengine shaders](https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/ebitengine-shaders/) by [quasilyte](https://github.com/quasilyte): a really complete tutorial with multiple examples of cool shaders being used in actual games. Very interesting and representative of the challenges and solutions you will encounter in practice!
- [Proposal: Go-flavored Shader Language - Kage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yVfqWY6B-yF0H3NOVff3r791_n2zUu8BUWdW9TuEorw/edit#heading=h.n7jq2wsb7j5k): the original proposal document for Kage. This was made by Hajime Hoshi himself, so listing it here under "external articles" might be a bit weird... but I really wanted to link to it somewhere for its historical value. If you ever asked yourself "why do we need/want Kage", here are your answers.
