# Showcase

- [Ferromagnetic](https://itch.io/jam/ebiten-game-jam/rate/1594587), one of the entries of the first Ebitengine game jam. Created by sedyh and YamelYAT, it's an experimental game featuring multiple cool shaders, including some great *Zelda: Wind Waker*-style water.
- [eliasdaler/crten](https://github.com/eliasdaler/crten), a port by Elias Daler of crt-lottes, a CRT (cathode-ray tube) shader originally written by Timothy Lottes in GLSL. If you are looking for that retro look, this one is awesome too!

If you have something cool to add, share it with us so we can add it!
