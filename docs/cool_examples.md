# Cool examples

Sorry, we have no particularly cool shaders to show directly... but we know where you can find some!
- [Community showcase](https://github.com/tinne26/kage-desk/blob/main/docs/showcase.md).
- https://www.kageland.com/, an online playground for Kage.
- [Learn by example](https://github.com/tinne26/kage-desk/blob/main/docs/tutorials/learn_by_example.md) (most are  really simple, but some are fun enough).
