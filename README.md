# Kage's desk

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

This repository is a project to make Kage shaders more accessible to Ebitengine[^1] game developers. Whether you are a newbie at shaders and need a [gentle introduction](https://github.com/tinne26/kage-desk/blob/main/tutorials/introduction.md) to them, you are a curious passerby looking for [cool examples](), or you are an initiated user looking for snippets and [cheatsheets](), we made this to help you out.

Without further ado:
- [Kage for newbies](https://github.com/tinne26/kage-desk/blob/main/tutorials/introduction.md): learn about shaders and Kage from zero. Practical oriented to game development.
- [Kage for game devs](): quickstart guide to Kage for those already familiar with shaders.
- [The pirate doc](): references, cheatsheets and shiny techniques for the seadogs.
- [The official doc](https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/shader.html): *the* reference from Hajime Hoshi himself. Concise and with good coverage.
- [Learn by example](): simple examples to serve as references for common techniques and problems.
- [Showcase](): advanced examples and fancy shaders from the community.
- [Debugging](): a guide to debugging Kage shaders.
- [Performance](): tips, caveats and figuring out if your shader is fast or slow.
- [Limitations](): limitations, technical issues and what may lie ahead for Kage.
- [Articles](): external articles by other members of the community.

[^1]: Ebitengine is a 2D game engine for Golang made by Hajime Hoshi, with a custom language for shaders called Kage that we keep abusing to do 3D. The official website is [ebitengine.org](https://ebitengine.org); the github project can be found at [github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten). Much love to Hajime Hoshi!
